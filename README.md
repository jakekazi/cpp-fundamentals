# Jake Kazi's C++ Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my C++ projects portfolio! This repository showcases my journey from learning the basics of C++ to exploring more advanced concepts, algorithms, and mini projects. Each folder represents a stage in my growth as a C++ developer.

## 📂 Project Structure

1. **01_Basics**  
   - Simple exercises to practice C++ syntax, loops, conditionals, functions, and other foundational concepts.  
   - Focus: Understanding how C++ works, translating knowledge from other languages, and writing clean, readable code.

2. **02_OOP_Projects**  
   - Projects exploring Object-Oriented Programming principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.  
   - Focus: Building structured programs that model real-world scenarios.

3. **03_Algorithms**  
   - Implementations of classic data structures and algorithms including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting algorithms, and more.  
   - Focus: Strengthening problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking in C++.

4. **04_MiniGames**  
   - Small projects and games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Sudoku solver, or other logic-based games.  
   - Focus: Combining logic, algorithms, and OOP in fun, interactive projects.

## 🚀 My Learning Goals

- Gain fluency in C++ syntax and features.  
- Strengthen understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.  
- Implement algorithms and data structures efficiently.  
- Build projects that demonstrate problem-solving and clean code.  
- Prepare for more advanced C++ applications, including multithreading and STL.

## 📌 How to Run

Each project folder will eventually contain a `README.md` or instructions for running the code. In general:

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd 01_Basics/project_name

# Compile the C++ program with Clang
clang++ main.cpp -o program_name

# Run the executable
./program_name
